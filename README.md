## 🧪 Project Overview

This repository showcases the **Model Testing Phase** of the absenteeism project, focusing on model performance across varying workforce sizes:

- **Department 1:** Analysis for a **Mid-Level Headcount Project** with **250–300 employees**.  
- **Department 2:** Analysis for a **High-Level Headcount Project** with **750+ employees**.  
- **Final Stage:** Combined data evaluation to test **model generalization** across both departments.

> **Note:** Department 1 and Department 2 follow identical methodologies, differing only in the datasets used. The goal is to test model adaptability to different project scales.

> **Historical notebook note:** Git history does not contain a distinct Department 1 notebook.
> The notebook currently stored under `Department_1/` is byte-identical to the Department 2
> notebook and retains its Department 2 filename. It is preserved as a historical artifact rather
> than presented as separate Department 1 evidence.

The confidential source workbooks are not included. The notebooks use the documented placeholder
`data/input.xlsx`; provide a schema-compatible, authorized dataset at that path before attempting
to rerun them.
