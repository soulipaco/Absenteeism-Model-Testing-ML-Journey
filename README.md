## 🧪 Project Overview

This repository showcases the **Model Testing Phase** of the absenteeism project, focusing on model performance across varying workforce sizes:

- **Department 1:** Analysis for a **Mid-Level Headcount Project** with **250–300 employees**.  
- **Department 2:** Analysis for a **High-Level Headcount Project** with **750+ employees**.  
- **Final Stage:** Combined data evaluation to test **model generalization** across both departments.

> **Note:** Department 1 and Department 2 follow identical methodologies, differing only in the datasets used. The goal is to test model adaptability to different project scales.
